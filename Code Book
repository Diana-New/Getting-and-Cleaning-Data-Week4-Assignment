Project Description & Collection of the raw data
The project is about "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set". The activity recognition data set built from the recordings of 30 subjects 
performing 6 basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. More details you'll find under 
"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones".
	

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Download the zip-data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it in a local order.
The downloaded order contains
  1) unlabeled training datasets x and y
  2) unlabeled testing datasets x and y
  3) 2 sets of subject labels for training and training data
  4) 1 set of features for the measurement
  5) 1 set of activity labels containing 6 activities conducted in the experiment

###Cleaning of the data
Using read.table, the raw data sets can be read rightly.

##Description of the variables in the total_mean.txt file
The total_mean.txt is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
The form of total_mean.txt is a text file, containing space-separated values.
 - Dimensions of the dataset: 180x69
 - Summary of the data: the first row contains the 69 names of the variables and the following rows contain the values of these variables.
 - the 69 variable names are: 
    "subject"
    "label" 
    "activity" 
    "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
    "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"

###Variable 1-3 are:
subject: from 1 to 30, indicating the 30 tester in the experiment
label: from 1 to 6
activity: corresponding to the values of the "label" variable. They are 6 basic activities:
    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
    LAYING
###Variable 4-69 are:
The 66 variables are features from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz 
to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another 
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals in the total_mean.txt are: 
  -mean(): Mean value
  -std(): Standard deviation


##Class of the variable: 
"Label" variable is factor type. "Subject" variable is integer type. All the other variables are numeric type.
